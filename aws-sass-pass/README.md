# üåê Full-Stack Java Web Application on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, MQ, ElastiCache)

This project showcases the deployment of a production-ready Java web application on AWS using **PaaS (Elastic Beanstalk)** and **SaaS (RDS, Amazon MQ, ElastiCache)**, secured with a custom domain and HTTPS via CloudFront and GoDaddy.

---

## üìå Architecture Overview

- **Frontend Access**: Users access the app via CloudFront using a custom GoDaddy domain (`https://vproapp.sdstudy.xyz/`)
- **Application Layer**: Deployed on **Elastic Beanstalk (Tomcat)** with autoscaling and load balancing
- **Backend Services**:

  - **RDS (MySQL)** for persistent database
  - **Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ)** for asynchronous messaging
  - **ElastiCache (Memcached)** for session caching

- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch integrated for logs and metrics

## üöÄ Deployment Flow

1. **Provision Backend Services**

   - Created and secured RDS, RabbitMQ, and Memcached with a shared backend SG

   - ![Elasticache](screenshots/elastcache.png)
   - ![MQ](screenshots/mq.png)

2. **Initialize DB**

   - Spun up temporary EC2 in the same VPC to run SQL init scripts

3. **Deploy WAR to Beanstalk**

   - WAR file uploaded and deployed directly from local
   - Beanstalk configured with custom EC2 instance profile & service role
   - ![Beanstalk Deployment](screenshots/beanstalk-deploy.png)

4. **Configure Domain & HTTPS**

   - Added CloudFront in front of ALB
   - Requested ACM certificate and configured GoDaddy DNS

   - ![SSL](screenshots/ssl.png)

5. **Security & Monitoring**

   - Used SGs to isolate traffic; enabled CloudWatch for logging

6. **Final App Access**

## üîê Security

- **Security Groups** used for network-level control
- **ACM SSL Cert** for HTTPS with CloudFront
- **IAM Roles** for fine-grained access (EC2, Beanstalk)
